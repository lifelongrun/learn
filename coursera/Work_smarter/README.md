### **Prioritize**

Each day, it is important to know what you *need* to accomplish and what you *want* to accomplish. What you *need* to accomplish is the priority. What you *want* to accomplish can be additional work you perform after your priorities are met.

Hint: Know what you want to accomplish and what you need to accomplish and when. Use this information to create your plan.

### Plan Your Time

A plan is only as good as what goes into it. In many ways, your plan is your task list. Rather than just write down things to do, you want to organize your tasks. Organize them by:

- Priority
- Due date
- Steps that need to be taken
- Start date
- Who it is for
- How long it will take
- What you need to complete the work

This is what will help you to stay on track. Consider creating your own template and testing it. See what best supports your needs and helps you meet your goals.

Create your own work plan using one of the following:

- [Our Sample Work Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0YiMxSMCLMe2a2JC1Ha8AYCLI6o5ErO_aPBS9hkp_c/edit?usp=sharing)(Below)
- Your own work plan
- An app, if you have decided to test one

Create a work plan for the next five business days. Keep it updated, keep notes on how it works for you, and make adjustments as necessary. The goal is for you to have an approach that helps you understand your work priorities. 

| Priority | Item | Due Date | For  | Steps | Estimate | Start Date |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
|          |      |          |      |       |          |            |
|          |      |          |      |       |          |            |
|          |      |          |      |       |          |            |
|          |      |          |      |       |          |            |
|          |      |          |      |       |          |            |
