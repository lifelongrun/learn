:pencil2: Project title: Self Introduction

My name is John Mike, I'm a college majoring in combustion theory and live Shanxi province in China. With taking this course, I would like to learn some basic academic writing knowledge to speed up the later work process of paper writing and publishing stuff. I want to write some valuable papers, however English is not my tongue language, I need to take this course to get me through the obstacle of the language gap. When I'm still an undergraduate on campus, I read a lot of books and have written almost 100k words about the topic of personal thinking and development, so I really love writing stuff something could interest my attention, English is a great tool to communicate and to convey the messages for most people live on the earth, and it's necessary to enhance our ability to write professionally and meaningfully. So it's basically my attitude towards writing.
