# Understanding Research Methods

**Emoji** that I get used to noting:

- :heavy_check_mark: represents the section (or week X) is done (or finished) by myself. 
- :white_check_mark: represents this small part is done (or finished) by myself.
- :red_circle: represents the assignment that I  need to work out.
- :pencil2: represents the original answers that I've written.
- :pushpin:/:memo: represents some Notes I take from the course.
- :one:â€”:five: represents sequence or importance, both is ok.
- **(submitted)** represents I  SUBMIT the answers, and it's the final version I've revised in my relative limited time.

## Week 1 - E-tivity 1: What Is Research and What Makes a Good Research Question?:heavy_check_mark: 

**Purpose:** To focus upon formulating a research question.

**Task:** Please compose a brief question pertaining to your proposed research - whatever the subject - and post it under the 'My Project' tab in the peer review exercise below. Be brief insofar as it would fit on one metaphorical or literal 'Post-It' note. Also watch our videos below.

**Response:** Having reflected on the videos, review other students' work. Feeding back is an important part of the research process, so please spend some time providing considered feedback for three or more colleagues here.

**Outcome:** You will have given considered thought to composing a research question and provided feedback to others on theirs.

### Introduction:white_check_mark: 

:memo:**What is an 'e-tivity'?**

E-tivity is a term coined by Professor Gilly Salmon (2002) to describe a framework for facilitating active learning in an online environment. Each e-tivity follows a format that clearly states to the students its **Purpose**, the **Task** at hand, the contribution or **Response** type, and the **Outcome**. 

### What Is Research and What Makes a Good  Research Question?:white_check_mark: 

:memo:Research:

- it must have a finite end at some point
- using information that is collected in a way that is as systematic as you can possibly be about the world to answer question; say something a little bit beyond the data itself

:memo:Research question:

- it has to have significance
  - something of significance, some issue, problem, puzzle question etc.
- it has to be well researchable
  - something that you can answer by doing research.
- it has to address a question that hasn't been definitively answered
  - there are plenty of questions that we might think are definitively answered because there's a consensus about the answer to the extent that it seems to be commonly understood what the answer of a particular question is.

### E-tivity 1:white_check_mark: 

:red_circle:**Purpose:** 

To focus upon formulating a research question.

**Task:**  

Please compose a brief question pertaining to your proposed research - whatever the subject. Brief insofar as it would fit on one metaphorical or literal "Post-It" note.

**Rubric**

You will be evaluated on whether the submission was genuine. Your peers will also provide 50 words worth of feedback on the submission.

Project title: My research questions

:pencil2:Hydrogen as a corbon-free fuel is expected to be fundamental clean energy in the future. At present, many researchers are studying how to blend hydrogen into natural gas to combust more effectively and safely because the combustion of hydrogen-enriched natural gas has some issues, like flame instability, and how to prevent its explosion, how to impact the current domestic/ commercial/ industrial appliances, and how to optimize these devices in order to accommodate the hydrogen admixture with natural gas. **(submitted)**

1. **Peer-graded Assignment**

:pencil2:Feedback

Sorry for that I don't have background knowledge of your topic, however, I think your question is very concrete. But as a reader I actually don't know what the question means, why it should be a significant question? What's your proof to persuade me of what you've proposed? So you can give more reasonable explanations for a better understanding. **(submitted)**

2. **Peer-graded Assignment**

![image-20220707112457700](images/image-20220707112457700.png)

:pencil2:Feedback

Can you write more sentences to specify what you've already known and not yet? Your answer is too short and there is no more information than I could know that "I don't know myself". So the basic advice is to write more sentences to narrow down what exactly you're questioning instead of a superficial answer. **(submitted)**

3. **Peer-graded Assignment**

![image-20220707113223413](images/image-20220707113223413-16571647461653-16571647499065.png)

:pencil2:Feedback

I don't understand your language at all, so please write in English to make other people to understand what you've written more easily. And a research question should be based on a research background which means the information you collected before should mostly come from the peer-viewd scholarly journals instead of one webpage or some other sources like social media platform. **(submitted)**

4. **Peer-graded Assignment**

![image-20220707114055931](images/image-20220707114055931.png)

:pencil2:Feedback

Your question is kind of like belonging to the research field about social science, so you can add a background to tell readers why is this question importance? And what's the main issue inside the question should be solved?  I think maybe you could make it more narrow and looks like more specific. **(submitted)**

## Week 2 - E-tivity 2: What Is a Literature Review and Why Do We Need to Do One?

**Purpose:** To familiarise yourself with the nature and benefits of conducting a literature review.

**Task:** Please read the following three pieces on literature review, in conjunction with the interviews below. Then post your thoughts on one of the readings to the 'My Project' tab of the peer review (200 words).

**Response:** Provide feedback on three or more submissions by your fellow students.

**Outcome:** Upon the completion of the full cycle of this e-tivity, you will be able to distinguish the qualities of a literature review and begin to reflect on the value of a literature review to your own project.

### What is a Literature Review and Why Do We Need to Do One?  

As you may have noticed, there are numerous books and articles out there with 'Research' and 'Research Methods' in their titles. They come in all formats and styles. Some are free and some are not. Don't be afraid to pick ones that work for you!

In certain E-tivities, however, you will also be referred to a particular section of a book. These readings have been provided to you in pdf form and can be found below.
