## Week 1 - E-tivity 1: What Is Research and What Makes a Good Research Question?

**Purpose:** To focus upon formulating a research question.

**Task:** Please compose a brief question pertaining to your proposed research - whatever the subject - and post it under the 'My Project' tab in the peer review exercise below. Be brief insofar as it would fit on one metaphorical or literal 'Post-It' note. Also watch our videos below.

**Response:** Having reflected on the videos, review other students' work. Feeding back is an important part of the research process, so please spend some time providing considered feedback for three or more colleagues here.

**Outcome:** You will have given considered thought to composing a research question and provided feedback to others on theirs.
