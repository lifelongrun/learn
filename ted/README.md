### Why I live in mortal dread of public speaking

>Megan Washington is one of Australia's premier singer/songwriters. And, since childhood, she has had a stutter. In this bold and personal talk, she reveals how she copes with this speech impediment—from avoiding the letter combination “st” to tricking her brain by changing her words at the last minute to, yes, singing the things she has to say rather than speaking them.

讲述者Megan Washington是一位具有天籁之音的歌手，同时也是一位严重的口吃患者，我不知道能否这样称呼（视口吃者为患者）。但你不得不承认"上帝为你关了一扇门的同时，在别处为你留了一扇窗"，那扇窗虽然不能与门相提并论，但仍然值得我们每个人去寻找和发现。
