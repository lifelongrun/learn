## End

Sometimes, but not most often, I can easily get a knowing through seeing what other people are doing and thinking. And it's obviously easier to take a concise knowing from the former people who have already concluded  instead of a truly understanding, so how to make an understanding more deeply? Here is an saying appearing in Leslie Lamport's presentation with his speech *Thinking Above the Code*: 

> If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.  

So I choose to write something down even more often.

*Please enjoy yourself.*
