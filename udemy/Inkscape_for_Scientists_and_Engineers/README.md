## Usage

As we've already known that Inkscape is an open-source software, so there are  a lot of tutorials for both beginners and advanced designers. After finishing this course of Inkscape from Udemy, I've already handled the basic and some high-level skills of using Inkscape, here some other online material for the future improvement, and they're also for those who are totally new and want to learn how to use it properly.
